				<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
				<p>
					<i>
						"continuous integration (CI) implements continuous processes of applying quality
						control - small pieces of effort, applied frequently."
					</i>
					-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Why generic-ci?</h3>
				<p>
					Using the 2GB fat Java continuous integration servers is often overkill for the feature
					set you really use. Often you don't even need Java on your server to build your project
					or you don't have the memory or space for that extra process. That is where generic-ci
					starts offering a lightweight, extremly simple and customizable solution.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Features</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Lightweight: pure shell based application with nearly zero dependencies.</li>
					<li>Flexible: can be used as a centralized server or as a single user without root access.</li>
					<li>Customizable: easily extendable through a plugin system.</li>
					<li>Language independent: write your QA and plugins in every programming language you want to.</li>
				</ul>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Installation</h3>
				<p>
					You can use generic-ci as a user or as a server. To use it as a server, install one of the provided
					packages. As a user, just clone the repository itself to somewhere in your home directory.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3><a name="user"></a>Usage as a single user</h3>
				<p>
					gitce can be used without any root privileges. This use case is targeted for
					environments where you can't gain administrator rights, you are the only one who works
					on your project or you want to develop gitce itself.
				</p>

				<h4>Installation</h4>
				<p>
					To get gitce just clone it somewhere into your home directory:
					<span class="code">
						git clone git://github.com/sarnowski/gitce.git ~/apps/gitce
					</span>
					You are now ready to use gitce.
				</p>

				<h4>Set up a project</h4>
				<p>
					gitce stores all data, nessecary for execution in <strong>~/.gitce</strong>. To
					set up a new project, use the example configuration and copy it to the data directory
					of gitce. The configuration file's name is the unique identifier for the project's
					executions.
					<span class="code">
						mkdir ~/.gitce<br/>
						cp ~/apps/gitce/share/examples/example-project ~/.gitce/my-cool-project
					</span>
					Open the new configuration file. The example configuration should be self explained.
					The only required configuration parameter to set up is the <strong>SOURCE</strong>
					where you define the source of your git repository.
				</p>

				<h4>Working with your project</h4>
				<p>
					By default, gitce runs a <strong>test.sh</strong> which is expected to be in the
					project's root and executable. If you want gitce to run another program, then
					you can configure it with the <strong>TEST_COMMAND</strong> parameter.
				</p>

				<h4>Do your job!</h4>
				<p>
					To use gitce continuous execution process start gitce:
					<span class="code">
						~/apps/gitce/gitce watch my-cool-project
					</span>
					gitce will now continuously watch your repository and run your program every time
					you commit or push something.<br/>
					To enable cool notifications or other features, look at the "<a href="#extending">Extending gitce</a>" section.
				</p>
				<p class="hint">
					To watch your repository all the time, even if you are not logged in, start gitce
					with <strong>nohup</strong>:
					<span class="code">
						nohup ~/apps/gitce/gitce watch my-cool-project &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
					</span>
					gitce automatically logs all actions in your data directory. Look at <strong>~/.gitce/logs/my-cool-project.log</strong>.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3><a name="server"></a>Usage as a server</h3>
				<p>
					It is not nessecary to run gitce as root on a server. You can simply use the
					"<a href="#user">single-user capabilities</a> to set up a watcher for a central
					repository. But running gitce as root provides more features. At first, you can easily
					set up a user for every repository seperatly and second, you can use the cool web
					interface.
				</p>

				<h4>Installation</h4>
				<p>
					To gain a full featured server installation you have to use the provided tarball
					or debian package (usable on all Debian derivates like Ubuntu).
					<span class="code">
						dpkg -i gitce-1.0.0-all.deb
					</span>
					or
					<span class="code">
						tar xfz gitce-1.0.0.tar.gz -C /
					</span>
				</p>

				<h4>Configuration</h4>
				<p>
					gitce stores its data in different locations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>/etc/gitce</strong>: configuration files</li>
					<li><strong>/var/lib/gitce</strong>: various data used by executions</li>
					<li><strong>/var/log/gitce</strong>: all log files of the projects</li>
			<li><strong>/usr/local/share/gitce</strong>: the web interface</li>
					<li><strong>/usr/local/share/doc/gitce</strong>: documentation</li>
					<li><strong>/usr/local/share/examples/gitce</strong>: examples for configuration and hooks</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To set up a project, copy the example configuration file into the gitce configuration
					directory. The configuration file's name will be the unique identifier for the
					executions.
					<span class="code">
						mkdir /etc/gitce<br/>
						cp /usr/local/share/gitce/examples/example-project /etc/gitce/my-cool-project
					</span>
					The configuration file is self explained. The only required option to configure is
					the <strong>SOURCE</strong> parameter. Read through the configuration file to find
					more useful configurations for your project.<br/>
					To enable cool notifications or other features, look at the "<a href="#extending">Extending gitce</a>" section.
				</p>

				<h4>Start and Autostart</h4>
				<p>
					To start watchers for all projects, simply run
					<span class="code">
						/etc/init.d/gitce-watchers start
					</span>
					If you didn't used the debian package for installation, you should use your system's tools
					to automatically start the watchers on server boot. If you installed the deb file, then
					this was already set up for you.
				</p>

				<h4>Timed executions</h4>
				<p>
					If you want cron based executions instead of executing on every commit, you can disable
					the watcher by setting the <strong>RUN_TESTS</strong> configuration to <strong>no</strong>.
					Now create a cron task like that:
					<span class="code">
						# cat > /etc/cron.daily/gitce << "EOF"<br/>
						#!/bin/sh<br/>
						/usr/local/bin/gitce update my-cool-project<br/>
						/usr/local/bin/gitce run my-cool-project<br/>
						EOF<br/>
						chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/gitce
					</span>
				</p>

				<h4>Web Interface</h4>
				<p class="hint">
					The web interface is highly exploitable and is not secure in any way
					at the moment. The web interface will not provide any user management by
					itself. Be sure to block any malicous sources. Only run it in your trusted
					internal network or secure it by granting only access to trusted users.
				</p>
				<p>
					To set up the web interface, you need a cgi-capable web server. For most users,
					Apache will be the right tool so here is an example of how to configure a
					virtual host for gitce:
					<span class="code">
						&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;ServerName gitce.example.com<br/>
						<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;DocumentRoot /usr/local/share/gitce<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/share/gitce/cgi-bin/<br/>
						<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;# Enable to allow unified dashboard usage. Be aware of<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;# security implications!<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;#Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"<br/>
						&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
					</span>
					If you set up a basic authentication, use your committers e-mail addresses. The
					web interface will give them a personalized view.
				</p>
				<p class="hint">
					<strong>Monitoring your project</strong><br/>
					gitce already provides as web interface which is optimized for a monitor. If you
					have a monitor in your room, point its browser in fullscreen mode to your gitce
					webinterface, appended with "monitor.html", like that:
					<span class="code">
						http://gitce.example.com/monitor.html?my-cool-project
					</span>
				</p>

				<h3><a name="extending"></a>Extending gitce</h3>
				<p>
					gitce provides a plugin system to extend its capabilities with various features.
					Plugins are automatically used if they are put into the correct directories. To
					execute a plugin before the main project's execution, create a directory besides your
					configuration file with the same name and <strong>-pre.d</strong> prepended. If
					the plugin should run after the main execution, e.g. to cleanup stuff, put it in the
					<strong>-post.d</strong> directory. Example:
					<span class="code">
						/etc/gitce/my-cool-project<br/>
						/etc/gitce/my-cool-project-pre.d/<br/>
						/etc/gitce/my-cool-project-post.d/<br/>
					</span>
					gitce bundles some basic plugins. You can use them easily as described in the following
					sections.
				</p>

				<h4>Mail Notifications</h4>
				<p>
					The "mail" plugin can send you notifications about failed executions and recoveries.
					It utilizes the git authors to send our the mails. To set up the plugin, link or copy
					it to your post-plugin directory:
					<span class="code">
						ln -s /usr/local/share/gitce/examples/hooks/mail.sh \<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/gitce/my-cool-project-post.d/10_mail.sh
					</span>
				</p>
				<h4>VNC server</h4>
				<p>
					For GUI or browser tests, you need an X server to be available during your tests.
					The "vnc" plugin provides the capabilities to start and stop a vnc server for
					the execution. To set up the plugin, link or copy it to your post-plugin directory:
					<span class="code">
						ln -s /usr/local/share/gitce/examples/hooks/vnc.sh \<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/gitce/my-cool-project-pre.d/50_vnc.sh
						ln -s /usr/local/share/gitce/examples/hooks/vnc.sh \<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/gitce/my-cool-project-post.d/50_vnc.sh
					</span>
					To enable the plugin, you have to define the DISPLAY parameter in your project's
					configuration like that:
					<span class="code">
						echo "export DISPLAY=:30" &gt;&gt; /etc/gitce/my-cool-project
					</span>
				</p>
				<h4>Cleanup Working Directory</h4>
				<p>
					To save disk space, you can enable the "clearwork" plugin in the post plugin directory
					which will delete the checked out content of the execution.
					<span class="code">
						ln -s /usr/local/share/gitce/examples/hooks/clearwork.sh \<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;/etc/gitce/my-cool-project-post.d/99_clearwork.sh
					</span>
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3><a name="plugins"></a>Write your own plugins</h3>
				<p>
					To write your own plugins you only have to provide some kind of executable. Link or
					move your program to the appropriate plugin directory (pre.d or post.d) of your
					project. There are various environment variables defined which you can use to
					prepare your execution or to clean it up afterwards. Use some simple plugin to get
					the available variables:
					<span class="code">
						cat &gt; /etc/gitce/my-cool-project-post.d/myplugin.sh &lt;&lt; "EOF"<br/>
						#!/bin/sh<br/>
						export<br/>
						EOF<br/>
						chmod +x /etc/gitce/my-cool-project-post.d/myplugin.sh
					</span>
					On next execution, the plugin will log all available environment variables.
